### The Urban Challenge

- More than 50% of all humans live in cities
  - likely to increase to 70% until 2050
- Climate change - energy and environment
  - most energy is consumed in/by cities
  - cities & the urban work and life are responsibel for the majority of the emissions of green house gases
  - reduction of emissions urgently required
- Concentration of production and traffic
  - stress of the local envrionmental (air and water pollution, noise)
  - mobility / traffic flows
- Urban development must consider all these aspects simultaneously - and at the same time getting more efficient
